Worst non working app ever.,Dissatisfied
For 2 years I have attempted to sign in to get digital coupons.,Dissatisfied
The app insists that I don't know my own email or password.,Dissatisfied
News flash.,Dissatisfied
"Hey DG, the thousands I've spent in your Tonopah store?",Dissatisfied
"I hate liars, so now YOU don't get that.",Dissatisfied
"I've had my # since 98, one enail since the 04,the other since 07.",Dissatisfied
I know them both very well.,Dissatisfied
Don't tell me I don't.,Dissatisfied
WRONG.,Dissatisfied
i have reached out and was on hold over an hour and the chat is always off even though i am trying to use during business hours and ive used these since they first started. why its doing this is because we never had to use the capital letter or symbol before but it either needs to be fixed or removed or not act like we are the ones doing something wrong. at this point i have tried calling and chat and yes reached out through e-mail but it never sends a link to reset password.,Dissatisfied
DG needs to fix the login issue with this app !,Dissatisfied
You see that a lot of people are having issues.,Dissatisfied
Why should we have to spend time contacting customer service!!!,Dissatisfied
Since the update everytime i go to login even after resetting password it just kicks me back out.,Dissatisfied
Can you please fix.,Dissatisfied
I did the update and it wont let me enter at all . closes out everytime,Dissatisfied
"in some stores, it can get confusing when you are trying to find what's on add...",Dissatisfied
glitchy,Dissatisfied
i love this app!!,Dissatisfied
the only complaint i have is how slow it loads when transfering between the digitals and the online shopping( for price checks while creating coupon scenarios) otherwise its a great app and has saved me lots of money with very little effort!!!,Dissatisfied
This app has been down loading for over an hour and still nothing.,Dissatisfied
Guess I will just go to the store and not have access to their coupons.,Dissatisfied
Disappointed,Dissatisfied
"Everytime I log in, it shuts the app down and directs me to my home screen.",Dissatisfied
Uninstalled the app.,Dissatisfied
It won't let me login.,Dissatisfied
I've tried multiple times and it keeps kicking me out.,Dissatisfied
"Since the last update, I had to reset my password (again).",Dissatisfied
"Now, when I enter hit ""Login"" the app closes instantly, every time. please fix.",Dissatisfied
loved this app before the update. now it gives me an error every time i click to go to coupons. says try again later. not happy!!!,Dissatisfied
ok so i used to love this app but now every time i go to log in it kicks me right back out im annoyed?i practically live at the dollar store and this is not making me happy i will change my review when im able to log in??,Dissatisfied
"App will not open, as soon as you log in it kicks you back out.",Dissatisfied
Please fix this issue.,Dissatisfied

I see I'm not the only one having the same issue.,Dissatisfied
"I go to login, and it does nothing.",Dissatisfied
"I clicked on 'forgot password', (trying to just mess with it) I type in my email address, and it says my email is invalid and I know it isn't.",Dissatisfied
Hope you guys get the issue fixed.,Dissatisfied

"Still waiting for update but nothing so far, Will rate app when I get to use updated version.",Dissatisfied
garbage.,Dissatisfied
I cant even create an account,Dissatisfied
"a principios era buena,después ya no aceptaban todos los cupones, ahora cada vez que se actualiza queda peor, yo mejor la desinstale porque esta vez no acepta nada,ni mi correo ni mi número de teléfono, mejor sigo con el otro dollar que al final son los mismos precios, ????? no mas dollar general,",Dissatisfied
AWESOME,Dissatisfied
"I've been trying to log in to use Digital Coupons, but keep getting error message 500.",Dissatisfied
Need to reset password.,Dissatisfied
"I spoke with a rep, who was very kind, but could not help me in resetting my password.",Dissatisfied
"Technical support sent me a few recommendations, none of which worked in resetting my password.",Dissatisfied
"After reviewing comments here, I see this app has plenty of bugs and very frustrated customers.",Dissatisfied
I'm going to uninstall it and call it a day.,Dissatisfied
"Digital Coupons would be GREAT, if this app worked!",Dissatisfied
I did update and the app will not open. it keeps cloing.,Dissatisfied
I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice and does the same thing. i love the app.,Dissatisfied
I use coupons often. can't save money if the app won't open.,Dissatisfied
Only reason I downloaded the DG app was for the scanner feature on an app that hasn't been upgraded since last year ?,Dissatisfied

great coupons,Satisfied
stopped working all together for my phone. had to uninstall.,Satisfied
Uninstalled because it wont let me turn off notifications.,Satisfied
"first off, as a DG employee i think that cooperate needs to require some more training on the digital coupon process and how to handle it when the coupons do not go through (as it happens ALOT).",Satisfied
"Second, alot of our customers are elderly and dont have smart phones, email address or even a computer and so they are always disappointed they cant get the coupon deals and i think that's unfair to them. last my experience with the app was great till i got a new phone now terms and conditions wont load",Satisfied
Trying to set up a account and it won't take my email,Satisfied
the best,Satisfied
price check option needs to be added to this app. cashiers are nasty when you price check.,Satisfied
not letting me log out or log in at all now. uninstall/reinstall 3x now. and doesnt work at the register 1/2 the time.,Satisfied
I like the app but a barcode scanner to confirm the product matches coupon would be great as the description and pictures are not always clear as to which products are included in sale.,Satisfied
"I used to go to Family Dollar more...but after several visits to Dollar General, I've found that their ""store brand"" items are MUCH better quality...ex: toilet paper, paper towels, their ""modesso"" Body Wash- much better!",Satisfied
"lathers generously...store brand ""tall can"" trash bags..etc!!!",Satisfied
Theres a much better value by going to Dollar General for hygenic items rather than a Supermarket!!!,Satisfied
HUGE DIFFERENCE IN PRICING!!!,Satisfied
"USE DOLLAR GENERALS ""SMART MOBILE COUPONS""!!!",Satisfied
HUUUUGE SAVINGS YA'LL!!!,Satisfied
Usually they always are stocked with wats in the ad.,Satisfied
Took multiple attempts to get the activation code to work then when I went to the store to use a coupon it wouldn't work and the manager couldn't override it.,Satisfied
Not shopping at DG again,Satisfied
you can never sign it the stupid thing.and it want except your email password exc .called customer service and he tried to help.grrrrr,Satisfied

Terrible.......too much time to download and set up account!,Satisfied
Deceived!,Satisfied
Spent more than planned to get 5.00 off from ap coupon and clerk tells me...oh sat only.....i didnt read fine print.....no apology.....stone faced look from unfriendly cashier,Satisfied
my digital coupons never work... going to just delete the app....,Satisfied
Massive battery use.,Satisfied
Runs in background with no use.,Satisfied
I think the app needs to include a barcode scanner for price check and to see if the digital coupons that we selected from our acct matches the item that is available in store.,Satisfied
"Also, please consider adding the option to see the coupons we redeemed in the coupon tab of our app.",Satisfied
Can't get updated ads,Satisfied
